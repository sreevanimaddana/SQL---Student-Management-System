# SQL Student Management System

## 1. Project Overview
The SQL Student Management System is a database-driven project designed to store, manage, and analyze student academic information using SQL.  
The project simulates a real-world academic database where details related to students, courses, enrollments, and marks are maintained in a structured manner.  
This project focuses on understanding relational database concepts and applying SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

---

## 2. Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To design a structured relational database using SQL  
- To store student, course, enrollment, and marks data efficiently  
- To practice writing SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis  
- To understand table relationships using primary and foreign keys  

---

## 3. Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL (for database creation, data insertion, and querying)  
- Relational Database Concepts  
- GitHub (for version control and project documentation)  

---

## 4. Database Design
The database consists of multiple related tables:
- **Students** – stores student details  
- **Courses** – stores course information  
- **Enrollments** – maps students to courses  
- **Marks** – stores marks obtained by students  

Primary keys are used to uniquely identify records, and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables.  
This structure helps maintain data integrity and avoids redundancy.

## 5. Implementation Steps
The project was implemented in the following steps:
- Created database tables using `CREATE TABLE` statements  
- Defined primary keys and foreign key relationships  
- Inserted sample data using `INSERT INTO` statements  
- Executed SQL queries to retrieve required information  
- Captured query outputs as screenshots  

---

## 6. SQL Concepts Used
- CREATE TABLE  
- INSERT INTO  
- SELECT  
- WHERE clause  
- INNER JOIN  
- GROUP BY  
- ORDER BY  
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG)  

---

## 7. Queries Performed
- Retrive all student details
- Retrive all student enrollment details 
- Retrieve all student marks  
- Retrieve all course details  
- Display students along with enrolled courses  
- Calculate average marks for each course  
- Identify top-performing students  
- Count number of students per course 
- Display students who are above 85 marks 

---

## 8. Output & Results
- Query results were validated using sample data  
- Outputs were captured as screenshots  
- Results demonstrate correct relationships between tables  

---

## 9. Project Structure
- One SQL file containing table creation, data insertion, and queries  
- One Markdown file containing query output screenshots  
- README file for project overview  
- This file for detailed project explanation  

---

## 10. Challenges Faced
- Designing proper table relationships  
- Writing correct JOIN conditions  
- Organizing SQL queries efficiently  

---

## 11. Conclusion
This project helped improve my understanding of SQL and relational database concepts.  
It provided hands-on experience in database design, query execution, and project documentation using GitHub.
